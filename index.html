      <p>I was very interested in coding and computers as a little kid. When I was in high school, I got discouraged from pursuing my interest further and translating it into a profession. All these years later, my passion for the creativity and intricacies of web development are stronger than ever and I realize that I have the drive necessary to go after my dream. </p>
